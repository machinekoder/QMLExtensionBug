This project demonstrates a bug (or missing feature) with Qt Creator and QML extensions. It is a slightly modified version
of the Qt Quick 2 Extension template from Qt Creator 3.1

Reproduce
~~~~~~~~~
Open the moduletest project with Qt Creator and compile it in Release mode. Then go to the build folder and run 
----
make install
----
This will install a new QML extension to your Qt version. Then create navigate to the installed directory (<Qt version dir>/qml/com/mycompany/qmlcomponents/)
and create a plugins.qmltypes file with the following command:
----
qmlplugindump com.mycompany.qmlcomponents 1.0 > plugins.qmltypes
----
Then open the qmlproject qmltest and wait until Qt Creator
has resolved all imports.

Expected behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Imports work as expected and are recognized. Qt Quick Designer shows the imported visual items.


Actual behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Imports from C++ plugins are recognized correctly. Imports from QML files are not recognized. Qt Quick Designer 
shows no visual items from plugins at all.
